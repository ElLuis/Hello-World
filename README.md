My name is Luis Sanchez. I'm currently enrolled in a Software Engineering program. I've come to love programming and I plan on serving a company with every skill I will develop in my course. I'm also into sales and music and I plan on mergin both businesses and making the most out of it. I just need to improve my time management.
